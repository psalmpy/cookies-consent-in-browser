# cookies consent in browser
 
When you visit a website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, usually in the form of cookies. Cookies are small text files that can be used to remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and personalize your browsing experience. However, they can also be used to track your online activity and collect personal information.

To protect your privacy and ensure that you have control over what information is collected, many websites require you to give your consent before they can store or retrieve cookies on your browser. This is usually done through a Cookies Consent banner or pop-up that appears on the website when you first visit it.

What is the purpose of this repository?
This repository provides an example of how to implement a Cookies Consent banner in a website to comply with data protection regulations. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be easily integrated into your own website.
